## About me
I am a quick learner, I can work in situations of uncertainty, when a task comes, you don’t know how to complete it, but everything is done by the given deadline. I think this is the best way to learn.
Plans to become a full stack developer. Now I am studying at [RS School](https://rs.school/index.html) on the FRONT-END development course.

## Code Example
```

b = {}

for x in a:
    if x in b:
        b[x] += 1
    else:
        b[x] = 1

for key, value in b.items():
    print(key, value, end=' ')
    print()
```
